  aboutMe: [
    "I am John Lester Escarlan, a Computer Science student at University of the Philippines Cebu. I build web applications with focus on clean, maintainable code.",
    "Currently, I work part-time at Wind's Gate Philippines, where I analyze system logs and identify root causes of errors - whether they're database connection issues, server crashes, or application bugs. This role has sharpened my debugging skills and taught me to quickly diagnose problems across the tech stack.",
    "I enjoy working with Next.js and Spring Boot, and I'm always looking for ways to write code that other developers can easily understand and extend.",
